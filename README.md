# BMP180 STM32 Library

This is a lightweight STM32 library for communicating with the Bosch BMP180 temperature and pressure sensor over I2C.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Read temperature (in Â°C)
- Read pressure (in Pa)
- Calculate altitude (optional)
- Based on Bosch BMP180 datasheet

## âœ… Tested On

- STM32F103C8T6 ("Blue Pill")
- BMP180 sensor module
- I2C1 (100kHz)
